# PaperJack
The "Paper Jack" project is based on the fairy tale called "Jack and the Beanstalk".
The graphical concept is paper feeling.
If you familiar with the game called "Maple Story" there was a map similar to this.
keep jumping to escape from the ground and clear the level!

this is just a prototype and needs to set up the map but hey it looks cool tho right?
